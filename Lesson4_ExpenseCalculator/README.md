### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned that variables are very sensitive when it comes to calculations.)
2. (Java and JavaScript are two different things, java is more independent and for applications and javascript is a language that usually tells a page how to look.)
3. (variables help classify the data that is assigned to it so you have to make sure that you type in the correct variables at all times or the calculations will be wrong.)
